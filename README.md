Description   
====================

Starter kit for my personal Backbone/Marionette applications

Ensure the ExampeApp.js under the js/ directory is changed in the context of the new application.

Remember app.js is your local file path
development setup. 

An example of Gruntfile.js and package.json has been
added, prefixed with 'example'. Be sure to remove these once you have set them up correctly.

Included a testServer.js file so you can effeciently debug your tests in the browser. Remember to change the configuration slightly (i.e. port number, dirname etc..).

====================
Development Tips
====================

1) 	Ensure a .gitignore file is in place to prevent
	unecessary items being pushed to git.

2)	Remember to create custom helpers for templating.
	e.g. Handlebars.js


====================
Testing
====================

1) 	Remember to include a config.js under the test
	directory.
